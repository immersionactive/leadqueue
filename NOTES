Possible approaches to source-mapping-destination:

1. Have a single `mappings` table, that hasMany `mapping_fields`:

   mappings
   --------------
   id
   client_id
   name
   source_id
   destination_id
   is_active

   mapping_fields
   --------------
   source_field_name
   destination_field_name
   append_as enum('email', 'phone') nullable
   destination_append_field_name

   mapping_addl_appends
   --------------------
   

   TBD:

   - What about append fields that don't have a corresponding source field (e.g., "Recent Home Buyer")?

     Perhaps these could be a separate "Additional Append Fields" section on the mapping form?
