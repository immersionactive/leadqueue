## TODO

* Refactor: Lead source create routes should probably pass the config type in the querystring, not as a route segment (to avoid potential route collisions)
* Refactor: merge StoreClientRequest and UpdateClientRequest?
* Refactor/bugfix: Figure out a viable way to default is_active checkboxes to true (I can't believe this is so difficult...)
* Check out [the throttle middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/routing#rate-limiting) for rate-limiting
* Can we enforce delete cascade on the lead_source table on the MySQL level? (Maybe not, since it's a polymorphic relationship to multiple tables)
